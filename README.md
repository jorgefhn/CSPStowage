On this project we will solve the Stowage's problem, assigning containers to cells, therefore enhacing the organization of a boat. The work consists on to parts: on the first one, we will modelate and implement a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) under various circumstances, and on the second one we will model the cost of the charge, uncharge and navegation of the boat applying the search-algorithm with an A* heuristic.
